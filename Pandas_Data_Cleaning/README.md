### Data Cleaning Goals:
In this project, I worked with a customer call list dataset to identify and resolve data quality issues. I simplified the data, addressed inconsistencies, and standardized the format to ensure consistency across the dataset.

### Data Cleaning Steps Used:

- Removing Duplicate Rows
- Dropping Irrelevant Columns
- Standardizing Text Format
- Formating Phone Numbers
- Spliting Address Column
- Standardizing Yes/No Columns
- Handling Missing Values
- Filteingr Out Unwanted Rows
- Resetting the DataFrame Index
