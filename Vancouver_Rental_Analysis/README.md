# Vancouver's Rental Reality

### ***You vs. Vancouver rental prices***

As an immigrant to Vancouver, one of the first things I noticed was how much of my income goes toward rent compared to back home. It was surprising to realize that renting in Vancouver demands a significant portion of my earnings, something I wasn't accustomed to. This observation led me to wonder: ***Is this a recent phenomenon, or have Vancouver residents always faced such high rents?*** 

Rather than just speculate, I decided to dive into the data and discover the truth for myself!

## Key Questions for Exploration
***This section outlines the primary questions driving this analysis of Vancouver's rental market***
1. Have rental prices in Vancouver consistently been high, or is this a recent trend?
2. How challenging is it for a minimum wage worker to manage rent payments?
3. Does having a greater number of rental units in a zone lead to lower prices?
4. Is renting a larger home significantly more expensive, or are all housing options hard to afford?
5. Which zone would be the best choice if I want to minimize my rent?

## Hypotheses
***Based on the key questions, the following hypotheses have been formulated to guide the analysis***
1. Rental prices have recently increased and were not historically high.
2. Minimum wage workers allocate a significant portion of their income to rent, leaving them with limited funds for other necessities.
3. An increase in rental units leads to lower rents, as there is enough supply to meet demand.
4. Renting a larger home is more challenging, as increased size is associated with higher rent.
5. Zones farther from downtown tend to have lower rental prices.
